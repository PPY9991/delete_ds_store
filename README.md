# Delete `.DS_Store` Files

This Python script recursively deletes `.DS_Store` files from a specified directory and its subdirectories. `.DS_Store` files are hidden system files created by macOS to store folder view settings, but they can be annoying when working on cross-platform projects or sharing directories.

## Background
`.DS_Store` is a hidden file automatically generated by the macOS system, short for Desktop Services Store. It is a metadata file used by macOS to store display attributes for folders, such as:
1. **Icon positions**: Records the arrangement, size, and position of icons within the folder.
2. **Background settings**: The folder's background color or image.
3. **Sorting preferences**: Records the sorting rules set by the user.
4. **View styles**: Such as icon view, list view, column view, etc.

### Characteristics:
- **Hidden file**: It is not displayed by default unless you enable the option to show hidden files.
- **Automatically generated**: If you delete a `.DS_Store` file, macOS will recreate it the next time you open the folder.
- **Cross-platform issue**: When copying a macOS folder to non-macOS systems, such as Windows or Linux, these files become visible. They have no significance on these systems and can be safely deleted.

## Features

- **Recursive Deletion**: Finds and deletes all `.DS_Store` files in the target directory and its subdirectories.
- **Safe Operation**: Only removes `.DS_Store` files without affecting other files or folders.
- **Progress Tracking**: Logs each deleted file and displays the total number of files removed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PPY9991/delete_ds_store.git
   cd delete-ds-store

	2.	(Optional) Create a virtual environment and install Python dependencies (if needed):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

Usage
	1.	Run the script:

python delete_ds_store.py

	2.	Enter the directory path you want to clean when prompted. For example:

Enter the directory to clean: /path/to/your/folder

	3.	The script will:
	•	Search for .DS_Store files in the specified directory and its subdirectories.
	•	Delete each .DS_Store file found.
	•	Display a summary of the operation.

Example Output

    ```bash
    Enter the directory to clean: /path/to/your/folder
    Deleted: /path/to/your/folder/.DS_Store
    Deleted: /path/to/your/folder/subfolder/.DS_Store
    Total .DS_Store files deleted: 2
